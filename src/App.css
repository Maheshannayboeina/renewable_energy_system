/* 
  We are keeping a minimal global stylesheet.
  MUI provides its own theming and component-level styles,
  so most of our previous custom CSS is no longer needed.
  This file is for small, global overrides or specific tweaks
  that MUI doesn't cover by default.
*/

/* 
  We can keep a global body background color to ensure consistency,
  although this is also often handled by MUI's CssBaseline component
  in more advanced setups. For now, this is fine.

  All other styles related to .App, .form-container, .dashboard-container,
  nav, buttons, inputs, and tables have been removed because MUI's
  <Container>, <Paper>, <AppBar>, <Button>, <TextField>, and <Table>
  components now handle this styling for us. This results in a much
  cleaner, more maintainable, and more consistent UI.
